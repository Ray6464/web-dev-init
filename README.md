# web-dev-init
A simple script to create project files and folders for a basic web-page.

The folder structructure goes like this:

/myWeb -> /assets + index.html + index.js + main.css

There are 2 scripts, a .sh script for linux users, and a .bat (comming soon) script for windows users. Just put the script in the directory where you want to create a project folder, double the script to execute it and you work is done.

All files are linked already, and has some basic code inside them.
